With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene        in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought      to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or        improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days.
